// Created this class and added all functionality here. After reading requirements and realizing that the Bot class
// has the same properties and behaviors as the Bot class, decided to create the HighlightableObject class that Item
// and Bot will inherit from. Nothing additional needs to be added here. Just a sad, lonely, empty class that is used
// for inheritance.
